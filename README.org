#+title: clj-hello

This is a sample repo to help new devs understand the working components of a Clojure project.

See the [[deps.edn]] file for details on the project dependencies, and their configuration settings.

The [[src]] folder contains the source files of the project's Clojure namespaces.

The [[test]] folder contains the test files, and are conditionally added under the =test= alias (or profile) in the deps.edn.

To run tests from the command line, execute:

#+begin_src shell
  clj -X:test
#+end_src
